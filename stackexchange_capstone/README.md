# StackExchange API - A data pipeline for NLP
## Project Overview
StackExchange is a network of question-and-answer websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process. Anecdotal user feedback, however, indicates that some communities and users are hostile and unhelpful to those seeking help. This project aims to enable whoever wants to use sentiment analysis or other NLP approaches on historical post and comment data to identify positive/negative communities.
